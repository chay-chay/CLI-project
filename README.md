# CLI PROJECT - Shopping Simulation

This CLI is a Phase 1 Portfolio Project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering curriculum.
I constructed my project to be a shopping simulation similar to what you would find on an online shopping application. It allows you to add products one at a time to a shopping a shopping cart prior to checkout.

## Getting Started

This program requires gem as below.

## Installation

    gem install lolize


    bundle install

You need 256-color terminal for best experience.

## How to lolize

Just require `lolize/auto`. it will automatically hook your `$stdout` and `$stderr`. 

### Bundler Gemfile

For example, you can do this in your rails project: 

    # Gemfile
    gem 'lolize', :require => 'lolize/auto'

### Any Ruby, anywhere

Here is the snippet:

    gem 'lolize'
    require 'lolize/auto'

You can even do this in your compass `config.rb`:
